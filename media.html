    <h1> Hello, my name is Abisola Oluyede</h1>
    <p>I am a digital marketer who currently leads the digital marketing team at one of Nigeria's topmost and foremost commercial banks. I am currently learning front-end engineering. You can call me a frontend engineer in transit.</p> 
 <img src="./Assets/Images/Corporate Shot.jpeg"/>
<p>I am currently enrolled at the School of Engineering to learn Front-End Engineering because as a digital marketer, this give me a technical edge that most people in my field do not have. I also want to do more than campaigns, I want to be able to collaborate better with devops teams, make informed decisions around user experience, SEO, and also be able to build my own websites and applications without waiting on technical support. Learning front-end is part of the steps I am taking to future-proof my career and position myself as a well-rounded digital marketer.</p>
